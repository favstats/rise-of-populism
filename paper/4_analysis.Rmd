In this section, a short examination of descriptive statistics takes place followed by a report on the results of estimated multinomial logistic regression models which are subsequently examined for their implications regarding the research hypotheses. 

\subsection*{Descriptive Statistics} \label{descs}

This section will introduce some basic descriptive statistics of the used variables. More specifically, we examine the support for populism over time, its geographical distribution and how it differs among different socio-demographic groups. Table \ref{summary_stats} shows summary statistics for all used variables.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{yearplot} shows the support for populist and establishment parties over the timerange that is present in our dataset (2010 - 2016). As can be observed in the figure, support for populist parties has increased in recent years and support for the establishment has fallen. Support for established parties has dropped from `r ess_year[1,3]`% in 2010 to `r ess_year[4,3]`% in 2016, reaching the lowest point in 2014 with `r ess_year[3,3]`%. The opposite trend can be observed for the support of populist parties: support for progressive populists has risen from `r ess_year[5,3]`% in 2010 to `r ess_year[8,3]`% in 2016. In regards to traditionalist populism, there was an increase from `r ess_year[9,3]`% in 2010 to `r ess_year[12,3]`% support in 2016. Support for progressive and traditionalist populist parties peaked with `r ess_year[7,3]`% and `r ess_year[11,3]`% respectively in 2014 and has remained relatively constant for 2016.

	{\scriptsize Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 87238. \par}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{regionplot} visualizes the support of populist parties for European regions as defined by the UN^[Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49). See: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/]. It can be observed that Eastern Europe stands out in regard to the support for established parties, where it is significantly lower than in other regions: only `r regional_ess[1,3]`% support established parties in Eastern Europe, whereas in any other region support is well above 80%. Most notably, the support for non-establishment parties in Eastern Europe is primarily due to traditional populists (`r regional_ess[9,3]`%). Regarding the support of progressive populists, the East does not stands out clearly anymore.



Southern Europe, like Northern and Western Europe, shows more than 80% support for established parties, but the south clearly stands out in regard to their support for progressive populists (`r regional_ess[7,3]`%). In regard to traditionalist populists, a very different picture emerges for Southern Europe, where support is just over 1% and thus hardly worth mentioning. Such low support for populists cannot be observed in any other region, where the mininum is at least 6%.

Additionally, Figure \ref{map} shows three maps and the distribution of support for establishment, traditionalist and progressive populist parties in Europe. One can clearly observe the difference of establishment party support between Eastern and Western Europe which goes right through Germany. The prevalence of traditionalist populist in Eastern Europe becomes rather clear to see, specifically in Hungary where the Fidesz dominates the political landscape. In regards to progressive populists, one can observe that East Germany and the Czech Republic, as well as Southern Europe seem to be the hotspots of support.

Figure \ref{plot2by2} seeks to visualize the socio-demographic characteristics of establishment and populist party supporters. The chart uses violinplots paired with boxplots, inside which the arithmetic mean is shown. The dotted line shows the overall mean. In addition, on the right hand side of each plot the results of a t-test are reported.

\newpage

A clear picture emerges regarding self-placement on the left-right scale in the upper left part of Figure \ref{plot2by2}. Those who support progressive populists generally locate themselves on the political left `r cite_box("cite_lrscale", "prog")`. On the other hand, the supporters of traditional populists tend to place themselves on the right-wing spectrum `r cite_box("cite_lrscale", "trad")`. One can also observe that the average supporter for establishment parties places themselves right in the middle of the left-right spectrum `r cite_box("cite_lrscale", "est")`. T-tests between each pair further shows that the p-values are below 0.001, indicating that all differences are statistically significant. At first, this  seems like a trivial finding, however these results once again confirm our operationalization and validate the idea that we accurately captured traditionalist and progressive populists in their respective categories.


With regard to age in the upper right part of Figure \ref{plot2by2}, it becomes clear that supporters of established parties are older than those who support populist parties. The average supporter populist parties is `r cite_box("age", "prog")`, in regards to progressive populists and `r cite_box("age", "trad")`, whereas the average establishment supporter is `r cite_box("age", "est")` years old. As the t-tests show, the differences between the group of supporters for established parties over the other two groups are statistically significant. However, there seems to be no statistically significant difference between the supporters of traditionalist and progressive populists in regards to age.



The bottom-left graph of Figure \ref{plot2by2} shows the distribution of education. One can clearly observe that supporters for traditionalist populists stand out with lower education levels `r cite_box("cite_educ", "trad")` than the supporters of established parties `r cite_box("cite_educ", "est")` or progressive populists `r cite_box("cite_educ", "prog")` and these differences are statistically signfiicant. The educational attainment differences between supporters of progressive populists and supporters of established parties is also statistically significant but only marginally lower for the latter.

Lastly, the bottom-right graphic of Figure \ref{plot2by2} shows the degree of religiosity by party support. Focusing on the the graph, supporters of progressive populists stand out clearly with a low average level of religiosity `r cite_box("cite_religion", "prog")`. Supporters of traditional `r cite_box("cite_religion", "trad")`and established parties `r cite_box("cite_religion", "est")` both share a similar degree of religiosity, with the former exhibiting higher levels of religiosity. As the results of the t-tests show, all differences between groups are highly statistically significant.

\subsection*{Multinomial Logistic Regression}

This section will present the results of multinomial logistic regressions used to estimate the support for progressive and traditionalist populism followed by a short summary and discussion of the findings in regards to our hypotheses.

### Results {-}

Five models will be estimated in total: *Model 1* only includes the results of the control variables. *Model 2* tests the economic hypothesis and *Model 3* tests the cultural hypothesis. Lastly, *Model 4* estimates variables of both hypotheses together and *Model 5* shows additional interaction effects between them.^[All models were checked by tolerance tests to be free of problems of multicollinearity.] Instead of a table, it was decided to use a coefficient plot in order to visualize the results, shown in Figure \ref{coefficients}. The big advantage of reporting the results in this way is that in addition to estimates and p-values, the relation and differences between coefficients can be intuitively read. 

\newpage

The results found in the descriptive part are further corroborated in *Model 1*. In terms of *Age*, the chance of supporting both progressive and traditionalist populism is `r cite_OR("control", "age", "prog")` times lower for each year that a person ages compared to the chance of supporting an establishment party. In regard to *Education*, the chance to support traditional populists compared to support established parties is `r cite_OR("control", "educ", "trad")` times lower per educational attainment score (`r cite_complete("control", "educ", "trad")`). With respect to the *Left-Right Scale*, the previously identified trend also emerges clearly: the chance to support progressive populists compared to support for established parties is `r cite_OR("control", "lrscale", "prog")` times lower (`r cite_complete("control", "lrscale", "prog")`), whereas the chance to support progressive populists is `r cite_OR("control", "lrscale", "trad")` higher (`r cite_complete("control", "lrscale", "trad")`). Not surprising are the effects of *Government Satisfaction* and *Trust in Global Governance*. Governmant satisfaction seems to decrease the chance of supporting both progressive  (`r cite_complete("model2", "govsat", "prog")`) and traditionalist populist parties (`r cite_complete("model2", "govsat", "trad")`). The same trend emerges for trust in global governance: for each point on the scale, the chance to support a traditionalist populist party decreases by `r cite_OR("model2", "globalism", "trad")` (`r cite_complete("model2", "globalism", "trad")`) and the chance to support a progressive populist party decreases by `r cite_OR("model2", "globalism", "prog")` (`r cite_complete("model2", "globalism", "prog")`) compared to support for establishment parties. Figure \ref{control_probs} shows the (average) marginal effects of the estimated control variables and further visualizes the identified trends (based on the full Model 4). 


\begin{figure}[!h]
	\caption{Marginal Effects for Control Variables - Model 4}
	\label{control_probs}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/control_probs.png}
	\flushright
	{\scriptsize Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 68403. \par}
\end{figure}



Next, the economic hypothesis will be examined in *Model 2*. Here it can be seen that the chance for support of progressive populists compared to support of established parties increases by `r cite_OR("model1", "econ_insec", "prog")` per point on the *Economic Insecurity* scale (`r cite_complete("model1", "econ_insec", "prog")`). Similarly, the chance of supporting traditionalist populism also increases by `r cite_OR("model1", "econ_insec", "trad")` with higher perceived economic insecurity (`r cite_complete("model1", "econ_insec", "trad")`). 

Similar effects can be observed with *Unemployment*, where being unemployed increases the chance by `r cite_OR("model1", "unemployed", "prog")` to support progressive populists (`r cite_complete("model1", "unemployed", "prog")`) and by `r cite_OR("model1", "unemployed", "trad")` to support traditionalist populists compared to supporting establishment parties (`r cite_complete("model1", "unemployed", "trad")`). 
In regard to *Welfare*, a different picture emerges. While there is a `r cite_OR("model1", "welfare", "prog")` times greater chance to support progressive populists when on welfare compared to support established parties, it should be noted that the effect is only slightly significant (`r cite_complete("model1", "welfare", "prog")`). The same does not seem to be the case for traditionalist populists, where being on welfare has no significant effect albeit it goes in the expected direction (`r cite_complete("model1", "welfare", "trad")`). Figure \ref{economic_probs} shows the (average) marginal effects of the estimated economic deprivation predictors and further visualizes the identified trends (based on the full Model 4). 

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\caption{Marginal Effects for Economic Hypotheses - Model 4}
	\label{economic_probs}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/economic_probs.png}
	\flushright
	{\scriptsize Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 68403. \par}
\end{figure}


In terms of the economic dimension, it can be seen that as economic deprivation increases, the chance of support for populists is higher compared to support for established parties. However, the effect of dependence on social benefits/welfare varies. Furthermore, almost all effects are significant in the model, and McFadden's $R^2$ increases from 0.22 to 0.23 in Model 1 compared to the control model and a likelihood ratio test shows a statistically significant better fit than the control Model 1, ($\chi^2 = 190.41; p < 0.001$).

\begin{landscape}

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}


Next, we examine the results in regards to the *cultural thesis* and focus on *Model 3*. Here one can observe that *Anti-Immigration Sentiment* increases the chance of support for traditionalist populist parties by `r cite_OR("model2", "anti_imm", "trad")` compared to support for established parties (`r cite_complete("model2", "anti_imm", "trad")`). As expected, *Anti-Immigration Sentiment* pulls in the opposite direction for progressive populism: for each point on the anti-immigration scale, the chance to support progressive populists decreases by `r cite_OR("model2", "anti_imm", "prog")` (`r cite_complete("model2", "anti_imm", "prog")`). 

There are also similar patterns regarding *Conservation* attitudes: the chance of supporting traditionalist populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "conservation", "trad")` times higher compared to support for established parties (`r cite_complete("model2", "conservation", "trad")`), whereas the chance of supporting progressive populists is  `r cite_OR("model2", "conservation", "prog")` times lower compared to support for established parties (`r cite_complete("model2", "conservation", "prog")`). 

A similar pattern can also be noted in terms of *Openness*: the chance of supporting traditionalist populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "openness", "trad")` times lower compared to support for established parties (`r cite_complete("model2", "openness", "trad")`), whereas the chance of supporting progressive populists is  `r cite_OR("model2", "openness", "prog")` times higher compared to support for established parties, albeit the effect remains insignificant (`r cite_complete("model2", "openness", "prog")`). 

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\caption{Marginal Effects for Cultural Hypotheses - Model 4}
	\label{cultural_probs2}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/cultural_probs2.png}
	\flushright
	{\scriptsize Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 68403. \par}
\end{figure}

The effects of the *Self-Enhancement* and the *Self-Transcendence* scale are also in line with expectations and pull in opposite directions for progressive and traditionalist populism. For each scale point on the self-enhancement scale, the chance of support for traditionalist populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "selfenhance", "trad")` higher compared to establishment party support (`r cite_complete("model2", "selfenhance", "trad")`). Regarding the support for progressive populists, the chance  of support for progressive populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "selfenhance", "prog")` lower compared to establishment party support (`r cite_complete("model2", "selfenhance", "prog")`).

For each scale point on the self-transcendence scale, the chance of support for traditionalist populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "selftrans", "trad")` lower compared to establishment party support (`r cite_complete("model2", "selftrans", "trad")`). Regarding the support for progressive populists, the chance of support for progressive populists is `r cite_OR("model2", "selftrans", "prog")` higher compared to establishment party support (`r cite_complete("model2", "selftrans", "prog")`). Figure \ref{cultural_probs2} shows the (average) marginal effects of the estimated cultural predictors and further visualizes the identified trends (based on the full Model 4). 





The McFadden's $R^2$ increases from 0.22 to 0.24 and the fit of the model is significantly better compared to the control Model 1, ($\chi^2 = 1790.01; p < 0.001$). As expected by our theoretical considerations, the effects on the cultural dimension went in opposite directions: culturally inclusive values seem to increase the support for progressive populists and decrease the support for traditionalist populists whereas exclusiveness seems to increase the support and inclusiveness decreases the support for the latter. It can thus be noted that the cultural dimension on its own is a meaningful differentiation between which form of populism is supported. However, it should also be emphasized that the effect sizes found here are rather weak.

*Model 4* includes the economic as well as the cultural dimensions. This further confirms the previously found effects. In terms of the economic dimension reduced effects can be observed. However, despite a slight weakening of the effect sizes, significances remain untouched and the estimates continue to show the expected direction. Moreover, the McFadden's $R^2$ increases from 0.24 to 0.25 and the fit of the model is significantly better compared to Model 3, ($\chi^2 = 151.89; p < 0.001$).

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\caption{Marginal Effects for Interaction: Economic Insecurity $\times$ Anti-Immigration Sentiment}
	\label{interaction_anti_imm}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/interaction_anti_imm.png}
	\flushright
	{\scriptsize Based on Model 5. Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 68403. \par}
\end{figure}

Lastly, *Model 5* shows two interaction effects that combine the economic and cultural dimensions. Pairwise interaction effects are estimated between each possible combination of the economic and cultural predictors. Only two of these interaction effects yielded a p-value below 0.05: an interaction between *Economic Insecurity* and *Anti-Immigration Sentiment* and an interaction between *Unemployment* and *Self-Enhancement* values. The small number of significant effects does not bode well for hypothesis H4. Nonetheless, the effects will be interpreted. 



For the interaction between *Economic Insecurity* and *Anti-Immigration Sentiment*, we interpret the marginal effects depicted in Figure \ref{interaction_anti_imm}. Focusing on the marginal probabilities for the support of establishment parties, one notices that support decreases quite sharply with increasing *Anti-Immigration Sentiment*. However, while the effect starts out lower for those that are most economically insecure, anti-immigration sentiment has a higher influence for those that feel very economically secure. This is an interesting finding and the opposite of what we would expect. Similarly, focusing on the support for traditionalist parties, the same effect emerges: while the probability for those with no anti-immigration sentiment is somewhat higher for those that are economically insecure, the effect of anti-immigration sentiment is higher for those that feel economically secure. On the other hand, the support for progressive populists decreases more strongly for those that are highly economically secure compared to those that are economically insecure, as anti-immigration sentiment increases.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\caption{Marginal Effects for Interaction: Unemployed $\times$ Self-Enhancement}
	\label{interaction_unemployed}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/interaction_unemployed.png}
	\flushright
	{\scriptsize Based on Model 5. Source: ESS Data Round 5 - 8; N = 68403. \par}
\end{figure}

Lastly, we take a more detailed look at Figure \ref{interaction_unemployed} where the interaction between *Unemployment* and *Self-Enhancement* is visualized. One can observe the already established effects: as self-enhancement values increase, the probability of support for establishment and progressive populist parties decreases and increases for traditionalist populists. However, in regard to progressive and traditionalist populists, this effect is even stronger for those that are unemployed. This is the expected effect that we formulated in Hypothesis H4. 

Although the McFadden's $R^2$ remains the same (0.25) the fit of Model 5 is significantly better compared to Model 4, ($\chi^2 = 47.41; p < 0.001$).
However, it should be noted that only two interaction effects of all the possible combinations between the economic and cultural dimensions yielded significant effects, of which only one showed the expected direction. This makes hypothesis H4 untenable and it must therefore be rejected.
