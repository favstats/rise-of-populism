### Data & Methods

**Merging with ESS (5-8)**

Two variables will be used to measure our *dependent variable*:

1. What party did you vote for in the last national election?
2. Which party is closest to your views?

--

**Resulting DV has three categories:**

Support for Establishment/Traditionalist & Progressive Populist Parties 

--

**Multinomial Regression:**

Independent Variables: 

*Economic Insecurity, Unemployment, Welfare, Anti-Immigration Sentiment, Age, Education, Sex,Left-Right Scale, Religiosity, Government Satisfaction, Trust in Global Governance, Rural vs. Urban. Regional dummies (East, West, North and Southern Europe) and temporal dummies (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016)*

**Total: 68.403 respondents in 22 countries**

## Conclusions

---


## Conclusions

+ Our conceptualization seems to be valid
+ Our conceptualization could be checked/validated by others
+ Communist parties may represent special cases with regard to our conceptualization
+ Multivel and bayesian modeling would be useful as well
+ Many missing values (include non-aligned in multiomial model?)
